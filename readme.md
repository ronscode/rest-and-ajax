#REST & AJAX

REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. REST is used to build web services that are lightweight, maintainable, and scalable in nature. The main aspects of REST are the resources which reside on the server and the verbs of GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, which can be used to work with these resources.
